<p>Flooding can cause major damage to a business structure. Whether it's caused by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged pipes, the water needs to be eliminated and the building's contents should be quickly dried to prevent structural damage, mold growth, and other issues.

However you can control mold development by keeping your home dry.<p>
<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier because it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape.
