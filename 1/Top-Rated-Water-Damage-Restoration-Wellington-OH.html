<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant action in the process is restoration. Restoration involves replacing materials like drywall and insulation. Often this process is as basic as installing a couple of panels of drywall, while severe cases could require changing whole walls. Direct exposure to poisonous substances like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older homes are most likely to contain these compounds.</p>

<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications.</p>
