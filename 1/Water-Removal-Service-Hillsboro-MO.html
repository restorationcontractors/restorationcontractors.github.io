<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve searching a broad location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the process is restoration. Restoration includes replacing products like drywall and insulation.
