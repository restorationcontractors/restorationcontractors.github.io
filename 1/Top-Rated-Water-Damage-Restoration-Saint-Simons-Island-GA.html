These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.
