<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floors is another possible impact of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise in some cases referred to as mildew, is a fungal development that establishes on damp materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a fundamental part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold development must be prevented. Mold reproduce by methods of tiny spores. The spores resemble seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature, moisture, and available nutrient conditions are correct, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are lots of kinds of mold, but all require moisture and a food source for growth.</p>
