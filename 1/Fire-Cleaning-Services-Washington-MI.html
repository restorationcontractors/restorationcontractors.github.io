<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or approaches will be the most reliable. It is essential to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature level and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building products and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
