<p>Drywall is in fact a panel of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between two types of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was very first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out an item called Sheetrock" suggested to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering.

<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold experts generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water quickly. This could intensify the problem since as you know - mold enjoys moist environments.<p>
