<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, quick air movement throughout damp surface areas of materials or assemblies is an important part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Quick air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area moisture gives way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical.

For these factors try to prevent utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, only utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
