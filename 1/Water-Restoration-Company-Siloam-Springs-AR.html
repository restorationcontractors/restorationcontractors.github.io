To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products soak up water easily.
