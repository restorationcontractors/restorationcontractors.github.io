<p>Before you clean your house, you need to wear correct protection. Soot, debris and smoke can be unsafe to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is considerable soot in the damaged location. Use long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You need to also use gloves and eye defense. Since you will be freeing soot as you clean, it is essential to lay down floor security and get rid of any furniture or home objects that are not damaged. You can probably get away with just covering furniture with plastic or sheets if the damaged area is little. But if you're cleaning a whole room, it's a good idea to get rid of those clean products and even seal other spaces that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you do not track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>
