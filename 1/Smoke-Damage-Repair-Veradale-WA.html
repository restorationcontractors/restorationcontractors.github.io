<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>When water freezes, it broadens, and that can be a problem for your home. Frozen water can cause pipelines to burst, leading to pricey and untidy repair. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to prevent a water disaster. As the temperature drops, keep a consistent trickle of water running to help avoid freezing. Pay unique attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that may not be getting the same quantity of heat as other areas in your house. Covering them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
