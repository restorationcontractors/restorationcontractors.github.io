Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
