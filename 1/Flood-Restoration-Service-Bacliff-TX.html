<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
