<p>The time it considers the mold removal procedure depends on lots of aspects such as just how much mold exists, where the mold is growing (behind walls, etc.), and the materials it grows on. Most mold removal (remediation) takes anywhere from 1 day to 5 days. Water damaged carpets and drywall will naturally dry. Even more, actual time drying helps to immediately change fan speed, thaw cycles, and more to help accelerate drying times in differing structures and conditions.<p>
<p>Keep in mind: While the majority of experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, listed below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and dust mites. Dust mites are microscopic animals associated with spiders, ticks and other mites. Dust mites consume mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins.
