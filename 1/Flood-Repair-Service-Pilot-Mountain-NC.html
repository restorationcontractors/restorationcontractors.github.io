<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run.

<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also often referred to as mildew, is a fungal development that develops on wet products.

Mold replicate by means of small spores. The spores are like seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, moisture, and readily available nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into brand-new mold nests where they are deposited. 1 There are many types of mold, but all require wetness and a food source for development.</p>
