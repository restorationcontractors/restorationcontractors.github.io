<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for lots of severe issues that can impact a building, damage personal effects and present severe health dangers to residents. To bring back residential or commercial property and protect health, an expert restoration specialist must carefully handle the job. They should be experienced in a number of disciplines, including stopping germs from spreading, preventing mold development, avoiding secondary damage, and saving the structure and its numerous contents. Furthermore, they should be able to communicate with the water damage victims and insurer agents with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the perfect breeding location for mold, while bad indoor ventilation can trigger molds to thrive. Wet structure products and humid indoor air are mold's buddies.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it passes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size.
