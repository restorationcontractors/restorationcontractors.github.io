<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier removes water vapor from the air utilizing a process called condensation.

LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or boosted action to reduce the moisture-laden air temperature when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
