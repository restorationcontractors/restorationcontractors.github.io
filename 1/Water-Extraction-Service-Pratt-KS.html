<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days.
