<p>Since it's difficult to get rid of mold in your house totally, it is very important to keep your air clear by frequently changing air filters. Think about using High Performance Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is normally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from distributing. You may also consider an air cleanser that will eliminate mold spores.

First, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities particularly if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more effective at getting rid of mold than a wet fabric and a moderate cleaning agent, so we recommend the least harmful option.</p>
