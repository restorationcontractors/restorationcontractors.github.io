<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish degeneration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration happens when you integrate electrical power, oxygen, metal and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal elements normally begin rusting immediately after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can work normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of an issue. How fast the rust process takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
