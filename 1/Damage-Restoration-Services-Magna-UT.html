Instead, I came inside to rain pouring down from the kitchen ceiling due to the fact that my child left on the restroom faucet throughout the day (9+ hours). I never ever needed to deal with this before, so I googled and selected RestorePro based upon all the positive reviews. From start to end up, it was an extremely positive experience. They effectively finished the mitigation and then worked with me through the whole reconstruction to ensure that 1) quality work was done 2) we might update where I wanted while being extremely transparent about expense and 3) that my home and my household were treated with respect. I would 100% employ them again if we have to go through a procedure like this again.</p>
<p>Jake (and his group) are awesome to work with. They fasted to respond initially and provided a affordable and fair quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done very quickly. Our mold issue ended up being smaller than very first believed so the final invoice reflected the real work needed and was less than very first quoted. Jake was very responsive to calls and emails addressing questions throughout the process. All in all, I had an excellent experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
