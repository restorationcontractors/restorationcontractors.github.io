<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach stability. Computing the humidity is important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would need to come out of the environment in a liquid type.

<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke spots. This stage is necessary, as these sponges use special chemicals to raise stains from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or merely grab a brand-new sponge. Ensure you utilize a cleaning movement the entire time. If you scrub the stains, you might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
