While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger enduring damage and ought to be dealt with by knowledgeable experts, heat is the most noticeable, and harmful, item of this chemical reaction.

Begin wiping the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a couple of strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning movement the entire time.
