<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

In addition to being damaging, black mold can also stain surfaces it grows on, which can make it harder to effectively eliminate. Frequently, surface areas with black mold might need additional lightening or replacement to deal with the stains. Sometimes, an encapsulating agent might be required to cover the stain and any remaining spores.</p>

<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Hayes</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is completed.<p>
