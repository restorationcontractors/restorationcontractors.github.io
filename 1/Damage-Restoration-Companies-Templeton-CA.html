<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were very handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

Lots of people swear by raw rice, advising owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a big bowl of the things (cover it entirely) and leave it there for 2 days approximately. A: Mold is a tiny fungi that becomes part of the natural environment and essential for our community.
