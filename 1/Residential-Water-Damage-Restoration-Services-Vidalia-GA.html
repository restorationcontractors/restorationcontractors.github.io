It is the progressive and slow degeneration of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally begin rusting immediately after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the rust procedure takes depends upon a lots of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
