<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Homer</h3>

If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
