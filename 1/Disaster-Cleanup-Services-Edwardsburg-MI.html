Nutrients for mold are present in dead organic product such as wood, paper or materials; mold can likewise derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires moisture, although some mold species can obtain that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent.
