<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a person or a household. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being completely replaced. If there is small damage then most of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The kind of wood flooring you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader range of choices to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface.
