<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. Sometimes cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water long.</p>
