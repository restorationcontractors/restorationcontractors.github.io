<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>

BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days.
