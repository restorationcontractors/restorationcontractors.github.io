Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
