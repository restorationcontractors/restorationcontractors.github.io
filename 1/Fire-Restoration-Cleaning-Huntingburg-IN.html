<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water stains, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Mold growths (nests) can establish within 24-48 hours, so it is necessary to act immediately if you have a water spill or leakage-- particularly if you live in a hot or humid  climate.
