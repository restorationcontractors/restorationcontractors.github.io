<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape.

<p>You wish to deal with restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew.

After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
