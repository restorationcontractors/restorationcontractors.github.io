<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Janesville - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health risk and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>After the flood waters decline and the clean up has actually been done, many folks want to return into their homes or services and begin rebuilding. The issue is that wood that has been immersed in water has actually likely soaked up a big quantity of water. Restoring too quickly after a flood can cause continuing problems such as mold development, insect infestations, and deterioration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>
