<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Bristol</h3>
<p>I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.<p>
