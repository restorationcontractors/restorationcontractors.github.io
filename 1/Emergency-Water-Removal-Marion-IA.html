The most typical areas in your house for mold development are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, crawlspaces, carpets and ducts. The very best method to prevent mold development is to remove water leakages or moisture in your house. See our short article, How Do I Prevent Mold Growth?" for mold prevention ideas.</p>
