The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need various criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings ought to be included in the drying record to include hvac, air, and devices systems. Wetness material levels for wet structural products must be tape-recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an acceptable range of pre-loss condition. It is essential to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if sufficient dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are required.</p>
