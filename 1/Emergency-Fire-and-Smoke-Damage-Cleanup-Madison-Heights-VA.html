<p>The area that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can easily take a trip once they are interrupted. Air purification systems are usually utilized in combination with the sealing of the location to remove as many airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location includes using both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air in between the polluted space and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading as well.</p>
<p>Food sources for mold in buildings consist of cellulose-based products such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and organic matter such as soap, fabrics, and dust including skin cells. If a home has mold, the wetness might come from the basement or crawl space, a leaking roofing or a leak in plumbing pipes. Insufficient ventilation might accelerate moisture accumulation.

The worst invasions generally take place in moist crawl spaces, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outdoors, and in basements with poor structure drainage.
