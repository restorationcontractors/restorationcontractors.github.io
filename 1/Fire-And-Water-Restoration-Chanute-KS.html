<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Chanute</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
