<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
