<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Search for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
