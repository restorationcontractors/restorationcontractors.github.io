<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or business is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being totally changed. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might require repairing. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require changing and often even the subfloor too. The sort of wood floor covering you may have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to take place. Solid hardwood flooring enables a larger range of choices to repair the issue. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can likewise have replacements for individual planks. The best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
