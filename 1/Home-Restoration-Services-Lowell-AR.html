<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
