<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Often it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal noticeable signs of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster material.

Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
