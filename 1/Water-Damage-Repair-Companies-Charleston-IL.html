<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job properly.

Some desiccants change color to show they are filled, which can take weeks or days, depending upon how much moisture products consist of.<p>
