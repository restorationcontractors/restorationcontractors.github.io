<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most devastating things that can take place to a household or a person. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being fully replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard might require fixing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor too. The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to happen. Solid hardwood flooring enables a broader range of options to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific slabs. The best method to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
