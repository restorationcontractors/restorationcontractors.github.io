<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
