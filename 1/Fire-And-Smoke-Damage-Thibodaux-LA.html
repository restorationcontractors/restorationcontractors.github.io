Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Do not attempt or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, draperies or other household fabric items. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the material, making cleaning harder. Utilize a dry, absorbent cloth to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent cloth. Make certain to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume secrets, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
