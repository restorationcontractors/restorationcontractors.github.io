<p>If you're truly confident about doing DIY repairs on your iPhone, the best approach to a wet iPhone is to loosen the bottom screws (on many designs of iPhone this will need an exclusive type of screwdriver head, available as part of some iPhone repair kits offered by unofficial third-party device makers) and access the interior. Use the cloth on the musty area to get rid of the mold with the sodium bicarbonate and water solution.<p>
<p>The time it takes for the mold removal procedure depends upon lots of factors such as how much mold exists, where the mold is growing (behind walls, and so on), and the products it grows on.
