<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job effectively. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
