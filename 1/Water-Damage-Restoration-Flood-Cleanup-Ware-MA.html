<h3>Water Damage On Wood in Ware Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Class 3 - greatest amount of evaporation, water, and absorption. Water intrusion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have soaked up minimal wetness.</p>
<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, duct and wiring.</p>
