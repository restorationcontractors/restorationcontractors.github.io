<h2>Conquering Mold From Water Damage in Davenport</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>

<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
