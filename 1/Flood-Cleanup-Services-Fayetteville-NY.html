<p>Because common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>We recently had significant water damage due to a washing machine overflow.

<p>Mold spores are found nearly everywhere, both indoors and out. If water or extremely high levels 1 of humidity exist in your home, mold development can begin in just 2 days.

<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Studies have actually shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was eliminated by ozone, the health risks would not be lowered till mold impurities are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not recommend making use of ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
