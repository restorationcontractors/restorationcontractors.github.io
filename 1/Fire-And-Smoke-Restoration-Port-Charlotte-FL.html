<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
