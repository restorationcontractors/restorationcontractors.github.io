<p>Note: While a lot of experts suggest a relative humidity of less than 60%, below 50% is best for controlling both mold development and dust mites. Allergen are tiny animals associated with spiders, ticks and other mites. Dust mites consume mold and dead human or animal skin scales (flakes) and leave allergenic proteins. Dust mites reduce allergen production at these lower humidity levels. Stop toilet texting - Browsing sessions and texting rallies always seem more urgent than they actually are.
