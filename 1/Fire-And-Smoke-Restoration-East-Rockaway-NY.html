<p>When you are planning large repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet.

Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
