<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In a black water damage, care must be required to not interrupt the germs in the water and make it air-borne. When bacteria is contained in the water and not sent out air-borne, it is not easily breathable by restoration workers or occupants. This indicates that windows and doors need to usually stay closed during clean up. The typical fans and blowers used to dry a structure that has actually experienced a clean water damage (non-sewage) must not be used in the early stages of a sewage clean-up task.</p>
