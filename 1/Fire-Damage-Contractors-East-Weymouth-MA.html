<p>Even when you include a little indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's because fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and many people know how to consist of a fire. For that reason, people will work to contain a fire without prioritizing smoke damage avoidance. Smoke is a little harder to see than the fire itself and appears less threatening.

<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach stability. Calculating the dew point is necessary in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas type. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point rises, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive wear and tear of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust happens when you combine electricity, metal, water and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no dependable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal elements normally begin rusting right away after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends upon a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
