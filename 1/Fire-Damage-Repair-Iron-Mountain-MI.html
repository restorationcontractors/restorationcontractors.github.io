<h3>Fire And Smoke Restoration in Iron Mountain</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health hazard and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
