<h2>Having Insurance for Water Damage in Charleston</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
