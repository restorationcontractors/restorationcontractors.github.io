Water intrusion where wet, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where products referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in minimal moisture.</p>
<p>Because big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas larger than 12 square inches might require a total replacement panel set up. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the space where you removed the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
