<p>Black mold can be harmful if it is Stachybotrys black mold. Many molds can achieve the color of black, however not all mold is the scary Stachybotrys black mold. So how do you know? The best way to tell is to get it evaluated by a professional commercial hygienist. Any mold needs removal, so please do not take any indications of mold gently due to the fact that there is either just a small amount visible or the color is not black. Enough concentration of any mold is harmful, specifically to more youthful kids and to the elderly, due to the advancement of airborne mold spores.</p>
<p>Some air cleaners are created to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Research studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at killing airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was eliminated by ozone, the health risks would not be lowered until mold contaminants are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise the use of ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
