Our mold issue wound up being smaller than first believed so the final billing showed the actual work needed and was less than first quoted. Jake was very responsive to calls and e-mails addressing concerns throughout the process. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
