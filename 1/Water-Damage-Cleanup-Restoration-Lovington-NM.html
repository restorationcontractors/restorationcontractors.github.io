<h3>Fire Restoration Services in Lovington</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water easily. This might aggravate the problem since as you know - mold enjoys damp environments.<p>
<p>A moisture probe, a tool of the trade, can support stucco and other exteriors to determine the portion of water in the walls.
