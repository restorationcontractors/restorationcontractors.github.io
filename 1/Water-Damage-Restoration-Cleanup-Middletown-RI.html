<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in assisting us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and also were very practical in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>

This file needs to clearly explain the steps that will be followed by the remediation professional, for instance how the afflicted location will be included or what the verification criteria are.
