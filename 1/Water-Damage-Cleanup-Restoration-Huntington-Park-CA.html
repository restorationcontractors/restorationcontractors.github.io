<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
