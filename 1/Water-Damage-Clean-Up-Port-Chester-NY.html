<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb showed up on the scene within a couple of hours and continued to drain pipes the area prior to any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed new insulation in the area. They offered excellent, effective, and professional service in addition to being friendly and pleasant to deal with. I completely recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again should the requirement arise.</p>

<p>We just recently had major water damage due to a cleaning device overflow. Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action necessary to avoid further damage burning the midnight oil into the night.

It was a satisfaction to handle the entire team. I would not think twice to suggest them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
