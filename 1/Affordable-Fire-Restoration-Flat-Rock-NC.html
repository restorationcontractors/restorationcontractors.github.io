<h2>Water Damage Restoration - What Are Your Options in Flat Rock</h2>

<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Thank you quite for your services on our floor issue. I speak for both myself and Dale when I state we were very happy with your company's service. It was great that you were available when we required you. I also want to applaud you on your patience. You handled the challenges of insurance coverage timelines perfectly. The work you did was great. As you understand I remain in the building service and know a bit about how things should go. I never felt anything less than professionalism and premium work. I would highly recommend you and your company to anybody. I can't thank you enough for your help.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we wish to address the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities specifically if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach disappears effective at removing mold than a moderate cleaning agent and a damp fabric, so we advise the least toxic choice.</p>
<p>Recent Review: A pipeline burst in my crawlspace, causing significant water accumulation. Colby and Caleb showed up on the scene within a couple of hours and proceeded to drain pipes the area before any damage was done to my home. Colby returned the next day and installed brand-new insulation in the location. They provided exceptional, efficient, and expert service as well as being friendly and enjoyable to work with. I completely recommend Affordable Restoration LLC and will call them once again must the requirement occur.</p>
