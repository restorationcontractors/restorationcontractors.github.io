It is customary for restoration contractors to gather the deductible in advance when work is to begin, and we will notify your insurer in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible might be deducted" from the last insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the project. Another possibility is that your insurance provider take the deductible quantity off of the amount they owe you for your individual contents. In all these cases, you eventually pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another manner.</p>
<p>Because common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
