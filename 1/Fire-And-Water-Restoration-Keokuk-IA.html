<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering. Once the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>
