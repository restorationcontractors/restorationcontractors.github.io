<p>Crawl spaces typically grow mold for the same reasons as basements do-they tend to stay moist long-term.

<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a hazardous scenario for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, polluted drinking water and absence of sanitation until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewage system can not work correctly (typical pipes problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater count on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to lower the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, germs and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those hazardous products can go into the groundwater and your drinking water supply.</p>
