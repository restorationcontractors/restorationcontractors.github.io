Search for noticeable mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke stains. This stage is vital, as these sponges use special chemicals to raise discolorations from walls. Never ever use soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread the soot and make it difficult to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always using a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces underneath. Or merely grab a new sponge. Ensure you use a wiping movement the whole time. You may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the spots.</p>
