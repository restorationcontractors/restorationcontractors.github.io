<p>As a leader in storm and water damage restoration, SERVPRO of Montgomery has the specialized training and knowledge to restore your home back to its pre-storm condition. Our restoration process puts an emphasis on clinical drying strategies, progress tracking and documentation. Not all mold remediation companies can provide a warranty, as mold spores are constantly present in the home. However, air screening can be done to guarantee that spores have returned to normal levels 1 and that all colonies have actually been dealt with. Talk to your professional remediation company for more details on what they may use.<p>
<p>Generators: When it comes to water damages that cause the loss of power, it is very important for the specialists to have a power supply. They typically have generators so that the equipment can be utilized correctly to repair the damage. Keep in mind that you need to have a pre screening procedure (mold spore tests, etc.), procedures (a list of how to remove the mold), and a clearance test after the mold removal to make sure that the mold spore count is at acceptable levels.<p>
