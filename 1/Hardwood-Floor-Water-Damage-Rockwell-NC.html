<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and likewise were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>

<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days.
