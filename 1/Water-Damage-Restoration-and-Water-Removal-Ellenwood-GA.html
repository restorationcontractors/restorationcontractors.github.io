<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is vital to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be calculated by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up.
