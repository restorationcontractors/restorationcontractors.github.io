<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on walls and floors is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Moldy odors can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have actually occurred and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we initially check for any safety risks, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for confined space entry. We then draw out standing water using our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has been impacted, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely get rid of it. We will likewise examine vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them if they have actually been damaged.</p>
