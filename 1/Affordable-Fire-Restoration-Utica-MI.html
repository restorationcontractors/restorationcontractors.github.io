<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to five lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a moist towel. Just like some of the above approaches, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough.
