<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, however it can happen on its own if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier creates the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical tourist attraction instead of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a product that brings in and holds wetness. This product acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is brought outside.
