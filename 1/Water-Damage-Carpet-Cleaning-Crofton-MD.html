<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in Crofton</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Now that you can determine when water damage is covered by your property owner's insurance, it's essential that you to contact your insurance provider as quickly as possible as soon as you discover water damage in your home. You must take pictures of the affected location and whatever that was damaged, along with where the water originated from, such as the burst pipe or Leaky roofing system and home insurance.</p>

<p>HEATING AND COOLING: Heater and air conditioning unit units can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot burner. They can also end up being muddy, and cleaning them will require expert cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and end up being infected. If that occurs, they should be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to prevent contamination from being blown through the air.</p>
<p>Lastly, we wish to attend to using bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities specifically if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at eliminating mold than a mild detergent and a moist fabric, so we recommend the least toxic option.</p>
