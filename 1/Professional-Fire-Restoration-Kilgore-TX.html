<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally recommend disposing of particular types of items and surface areas. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical products in requirement of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which also consists of vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles overlooked in the remediation procedure. A special HEPA vacuum makes sure that even tiny particles get collected to decrease the opportunities of the mold moving elsewhere. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold. We want to make twice as sure that mold doesn't discover a way out of the consisted of work area and into a various part of the structure.</p>
