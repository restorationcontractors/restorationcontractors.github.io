Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces beneath. Or simply grab a new sponge. Ensure you use a cleaning motion the entire time.
