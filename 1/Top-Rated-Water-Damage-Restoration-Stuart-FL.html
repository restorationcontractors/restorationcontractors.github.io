<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and good, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has actually leaked for months and gone without repair work, mold can grow as a result, but it will not be covered by your property owners insurance. Given that floods can also cause mold, any possible mold that grows as a result of a flood would be covered by flood insurance coverage, if you have it. Need to you send a claim for mold damage, this cause would be examined and identified by the flood insurance adjuster.</p>
