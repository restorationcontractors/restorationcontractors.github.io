<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts usually advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall.
