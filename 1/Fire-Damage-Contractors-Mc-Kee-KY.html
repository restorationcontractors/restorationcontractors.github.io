Burst or damaged pipes can be a major headache when you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is originating from.

<p>Finally, we wish to address using bleach on mold. Using bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Professional Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical level of sensitivities specifically if used in locations that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at eliminating mold than a wet fabric and a mild cleaning agent, so we suggest the least poisonous option.</p>
