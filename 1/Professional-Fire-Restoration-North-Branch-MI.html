When the conditions are right, mold can grow within 24-48 hours. Leaving mold unattended can cause breathing health problems as well as be a major factor for year-round allergies.

If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Epa's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".
