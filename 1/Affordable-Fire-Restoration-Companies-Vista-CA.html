<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can offer your living-room a sense of heat and comfort even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can often let in rain during the chillier months which can seep through the walls. With time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to peel, flake and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into an unloved and exhausted  space.<p>
