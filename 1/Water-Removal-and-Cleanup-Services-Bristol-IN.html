<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.
