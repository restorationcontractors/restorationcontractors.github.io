<h3>Smoke Damage Removal in Salisbury</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health risk and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not eliminate mold. Try to keep yourself, kids, workers and others out of the affected location. Attempting to dry the location with a fan may disturb the spores and spread them to a new location.
