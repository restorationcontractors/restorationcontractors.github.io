<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of residential or commercial property damage that a family or organisation can experience. When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
