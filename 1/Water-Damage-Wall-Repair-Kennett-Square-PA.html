Start wiping the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface. When all sides are stained, slice off the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or simply grab a brand-new sponge. Make certain you utilize a cleaning motion the whole time. If you scrub the spots, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
