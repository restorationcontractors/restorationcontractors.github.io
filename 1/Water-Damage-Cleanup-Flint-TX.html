Temperature levels well above 100 F will eliminate mold and mold spores, but the exact temperature level required to kill specific species is not well developed.<p>
<p>The most significant component that can be removed is the moisture that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of types of mold, however the most typical kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive at a food source that is warm and wet, it starts to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours.
