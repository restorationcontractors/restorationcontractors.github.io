<p>Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
