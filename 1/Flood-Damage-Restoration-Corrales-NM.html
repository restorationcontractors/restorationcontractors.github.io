<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

We will then supply you with a drying plan and the correct devices to complete the procedure. We invest heavily in the most up-to-date drying devices to control the drying procedure. Advanced evaluation tools will verify the drying procedure and even assist in finding any concealed pockets of water.</p>
