<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally damaging. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
