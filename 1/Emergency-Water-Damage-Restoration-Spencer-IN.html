To start addressing a water damaged wall or ceiling in your house, you should recognize the source of the water.

<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also sometimes described as mildew, is a fungal growth that establishes on damp materials.

Mold recreate by means of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surfaces.
