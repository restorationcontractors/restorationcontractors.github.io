<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Richmond: What to Do After a Storm</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>An insurance plan may or might not cover the costs related to water damage and the procedure of water damage restoration. While a common reason for residential water damage is often the failure of a sump pump, many property owner's insurance policies do not cover the associated expenses without an addendum which contributes to the month-to-month premium of the policy. Typically the terminology of this addendum resembles "Sewer and Drain Pipes Protection".</p>
