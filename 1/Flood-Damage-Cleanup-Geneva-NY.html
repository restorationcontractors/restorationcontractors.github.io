<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in tough to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are preferable when drying under carpet and padding. Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout wet surfaces, vaporizing moisture into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, an enough variety of centrifugal fans are chosen.</p>
<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. It can be a long-term health hazard and need to be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This develops a chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, duct work and circuitry.</p>
