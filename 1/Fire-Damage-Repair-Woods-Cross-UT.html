<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or techniques will be the most efficient. It is vital to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and latent energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several structure materials and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
