<p>If you pick to hire a contractor (or other professional provider) to do the cleanup, make certain the professional has experience cleaning up mold.

Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Professional Mold Remediation.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach disappears efficient at getting rid of mold than a mild cleaning agent and a moist fabric, so we suggest the least poisonous alternative.</p>
<p>Equipment used in mold remediation consists of: moisture meter: measures drying of damaged products; Humidity gauge: often paired with a thermometer; borescope: Camera at the end of a versatile snake, illuminating possible mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl areas; digital camera: Files findings throughout assessment; personal protective devices (PPE): Respirators, gloves, impervious suit, and eye defense; thermographic camera: Infrared thermal-imaging cameras recognize secondary wetness sources.</p>
