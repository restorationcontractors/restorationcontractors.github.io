<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Cabot</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
