<p>Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. Remove paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. It can be a permanent health hazard and must be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, duct work and wiring.</p>
