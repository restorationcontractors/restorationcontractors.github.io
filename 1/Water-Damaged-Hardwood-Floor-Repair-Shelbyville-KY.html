They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
