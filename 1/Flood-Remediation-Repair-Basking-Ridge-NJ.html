<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. Once the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
