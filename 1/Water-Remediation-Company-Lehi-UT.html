<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
