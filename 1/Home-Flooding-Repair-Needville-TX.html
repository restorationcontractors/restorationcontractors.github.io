<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or organisation can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
