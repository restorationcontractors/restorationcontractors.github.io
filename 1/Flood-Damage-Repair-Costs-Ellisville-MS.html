<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
