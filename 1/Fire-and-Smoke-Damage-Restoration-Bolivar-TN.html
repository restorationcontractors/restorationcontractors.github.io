<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or business is one of the most devastating things that can take place to an individual or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed rather than being completely changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need repairing, if there is small damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require changing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The type of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to take place. Solid hardwood floor covering permits a larger series of options to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can likewise have replacements for specific slabs. The best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
