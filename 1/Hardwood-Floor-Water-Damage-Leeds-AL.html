<p>Unfavorable air devices, equipped with HEPA (high effectiveness particle air filters") ought to be made use of to remove germs and other contaminants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage need to be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with appropriate waste holding tanks which must be disposed of appropriately. Difficult surface areas that are affected should be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be removed and properly gotten rid of.
