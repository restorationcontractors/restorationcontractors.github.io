<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is an extreme, corrosive chemical. When blended with ammonia, chlorine bleach likewise offers off severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas. There are more secure options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce hazardous fumes or leave behind poisonous residue. For these factors attempt to prevent using bleach and if you should utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
