Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
