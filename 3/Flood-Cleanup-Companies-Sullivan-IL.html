<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being polluted with molds.

When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
