<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, building envelope problems, and building problems are a very serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding locations are experiencing countless problems due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living centers, apartments, condos, townhomes, hotels, commercial buildings are particularly vulnerable to these problems as usually the home builder subcontracts the outside envelope work and wall assembly procedure, therefore leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
