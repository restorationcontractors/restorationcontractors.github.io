Before mold is located, you might smell a distinct moldy scent or experience allergic reaction signs due to mold direct exposure. These smells are particularly pungent in locations like the basement. The foul smell resembles the aroma of wet, musty laundry. Sadly, it's not unusual for house owners to mistake mold growth for dirt.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
