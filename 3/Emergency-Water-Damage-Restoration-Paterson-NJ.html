<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
