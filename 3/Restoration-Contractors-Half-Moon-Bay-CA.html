Your homeowner's insurance coverage likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance coverage. If the flood has actually been stated a federal disaster by the President, obtain assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>

Consequently, water mitigators realize the value of a quick response. In basic, the time it requires to mitigate a home depends upon how extreme the water damage is.<p>
