Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
