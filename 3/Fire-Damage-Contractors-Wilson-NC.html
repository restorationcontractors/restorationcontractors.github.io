<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and moist, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Mold growths (nests) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is essential to act instantly if you have a water spill or leakage-- especially if you live in a hot or damp  environment. If you are past the point of Do It Yourself and need professional aid, mold remediation teams will pertain to your area, examine the level of the mold problem, identify and correct all water leaks and sources of moisture, identify all mold sources (both visible and covert), use customized devices to consist of and prevent migration of mold spores, safely remove contaminated products, treat infested areas with approved antimicrobial sprays, dehumidify and dry the proper locations, and seal locations as needed.</p>
