<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Gate City</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and must be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
