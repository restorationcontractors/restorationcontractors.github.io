<h3>Professional Fire Restoration in Gate City</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be an irreversible health hazard and must be eliminated.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
