They came back every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
