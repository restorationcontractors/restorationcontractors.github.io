Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days.
