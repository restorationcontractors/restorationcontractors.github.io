<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
