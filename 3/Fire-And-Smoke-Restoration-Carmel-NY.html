Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
