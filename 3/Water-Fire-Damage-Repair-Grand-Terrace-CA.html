By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges.

When the task is completed, this assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
