<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Scott: What to Do After a Storm</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and likewise were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>

<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall because mold and mildew can be a severe health danger. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Damaged locations larger than 12 square inches might need a complete replacement panel installed since big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the space where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may need to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
