<p>When you are preparing large repair work, remember that drywall features a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
