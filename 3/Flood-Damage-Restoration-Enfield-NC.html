<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold is a typical perpetrator of damage in much of our organisations and houses here in Central Illinois. When moisture is present, mold spores can spread out rapidly. Frequently it can take hold in less than 48 hours after a wetness damage has occurred. The development not only triggers damages to structures and surfaces but has the prospective to produce irritants and irritants that have the possible to trigger other health effects. If you believe that your home or service has a mold issue, please call us at 217-528-7775. Our crew has the certifications, knowledge, and experience to remediate the damage.</p>
