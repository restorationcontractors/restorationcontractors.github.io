<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
