<h2>Conquering Mold From Water Damage in Ashland</h2>

<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

An unique HEPA vacuum guarantees that even small particles get collected to minimize the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make doubly sure that mold doesn't discover a way out of the consisted of work area and into a different part of the structure.</p>
