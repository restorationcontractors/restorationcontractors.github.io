It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For instance, if the area where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to replace the entire drywall panel.</p>
<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Farmington</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
