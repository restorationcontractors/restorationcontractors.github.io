The worst infestations typically happen in wet crawl areas, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with poor structure drain. Stopping leaks, guaranteeing excellent ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the foundation are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
