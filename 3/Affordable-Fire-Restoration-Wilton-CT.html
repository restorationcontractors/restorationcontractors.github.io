<p>One of our first jobs when we find mold in a structure is to cordon off that area to stop it from spreading. We use tools like plastic sheeting and air scrubbers to find additional mold growth.

<p>After you learn how to get rid of mold, concentrate on avoiding it in the future. Controlling moisture is the crucial to stopping most mold. The worst infestations typically happen in wet crawl areas, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with poor structure drain. Stopping leaks, guaranteeing excellent ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the foundation are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
