<h2>Main Causes of Home Water Damage in Clinton</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
