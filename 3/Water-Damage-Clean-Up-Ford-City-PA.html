<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the presence of a mold problem requiring action and the level of damage then writes a clear scope of work consisting of suitable standards. This file must plainly describe the actions that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for instance how the afflicted location will be contained or what the verification criteria are. Without a clear arrangement in writing the conclusions, data, measurements are left to the analysis of each celebration.</p>
