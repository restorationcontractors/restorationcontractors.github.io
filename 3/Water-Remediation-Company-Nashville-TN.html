<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can give your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and cracked chimney can typically let in rain during the cooler months which can seep through the walls. In time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a exhausted and unloved area.<p>
<p>Evaluate the damage and assess triggered by the fire and or smoke. Wait a minimum of 2 days. The longer you can wait, the more successful your drying procedure will be. 72 hours may be even more effective if you can wait longer than 48 hours. Look no even more if you want prompt service. Every call I made received a response or response back immediately. Specialist and practical throughout! Thank you Gateway Restoration team!
