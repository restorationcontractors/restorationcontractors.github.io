<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any hard surfaces to remove the mold from the surface. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furnishings, clothes, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are gotten rid of, usually involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
