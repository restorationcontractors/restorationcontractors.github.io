Calculating the humidity is important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always happens at 100% relative humidity (RH).

We have the equipment to quickly eliminate the water and after that dry your house so you don't have to fret about mold or mildew beginning to grow.<p>
<p>The greatest element that can be eliminated is the moisture that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most typical types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is moist and warm, it starts to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to turn into the food source and mycotoxins or toxic gasses are launched as the fungis spreads. Mold in your home can be exceptionally harmful and cause a range of health issues. If the mold in your home is not eliminated effectively it can continue to grow, making effective mold remediation more expensive and challenging.<p>
