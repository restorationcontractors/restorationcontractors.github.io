The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure.
