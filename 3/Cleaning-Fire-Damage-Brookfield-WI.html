When MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>
