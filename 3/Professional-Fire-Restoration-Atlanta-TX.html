<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always tries to reach balance. Computing the humidity is essential in drying since when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The dew point constantly happens at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The greater the humidity increases, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>
