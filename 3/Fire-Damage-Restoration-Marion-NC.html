Numerous houses with water damage absence fundamental weatherproofing materials, assessment reports state. Coats of stucco are frequently too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, craftsmanship was so poor that, even prior to the family moved in, a mushroom sprouted in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bedroom.</p>

Clean water from tough surface areas, and repair leaking faucets as quickly as possible.

<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide.
