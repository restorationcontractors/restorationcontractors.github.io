<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are utilized on any hard surface areas to eliminate the mold from the surface. If anything can be gotten rid of, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eradicated, typically including deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
