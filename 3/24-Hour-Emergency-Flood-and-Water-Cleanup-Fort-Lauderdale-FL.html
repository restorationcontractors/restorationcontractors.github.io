After a heavy rain storm, a fast reaction is CRITICAL to minimizing possible secondary damages and expenses to your Portland home or business.

Refrigerators, hot water heater, washing dishwaters and makers are all have numerous parts that are vulnerable to wear and tear, so keep a mindful watch on older designs.
