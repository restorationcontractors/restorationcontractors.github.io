They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
