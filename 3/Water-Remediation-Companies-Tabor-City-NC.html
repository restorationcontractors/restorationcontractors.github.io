<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to examine which drying devices or techniques will be the most effective. It is essential to identify if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building products and how they respond to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The greater the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
