<p>A portable dehumidifier can get rid of water vapor from the air in a contained area, like a bed room or downstairs rec space. Shut the space's doors and windows to prevent more humidity from leaking in. Purchase a big dehumidifier ($ 270) so you don't need to clear its water drawer often. First things first. Get the iPhone out of the water right away, if you haven't currently. And do not even consider plugging it in.<p>
