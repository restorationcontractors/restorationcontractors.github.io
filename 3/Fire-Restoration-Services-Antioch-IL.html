<p>We hear a lot about mold nowadays, the risks and the dangers. Mold not just triggers unhealthy conditions however can also cause structural damage. At ServiceMaster of Seattle, we're constantly looking for ways to help you, your family and your home.

<p>There are 2 ways in which water goes into a building as a result of windstorm damage. Because of damage to roofing components or wall assemblies, the first includes falling or windblown rainwater that gets in. The 2nd involves horizontally traveling ground-surface water (Category 3) consisting of silt and soil pollutants that infiltrates into structures, usually through doors or around structure walls. This ground-surface water (storm rise) may accumulate to a depth of several feet or several inches. Far more elaborate procedures normally are required when structures are partly submerged or stay significantly flooded for weeks</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every single two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the intake where it travels through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
