<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold developments (nests) can establish within 24-48 hours, so it is essential to act instantly if you have a water spill or leak-- particularly if you live in a humid or hot climate.
