<p>There are 3 basic actions to the water damage restoration procedure. The first step is to eliminate all of the water from the impacted residential or commercial property. That indicates correcting any plumbing problems, fixing any problems that could be causing condensation, or waiting for the floodwaters to decline, depending upon the situations.
