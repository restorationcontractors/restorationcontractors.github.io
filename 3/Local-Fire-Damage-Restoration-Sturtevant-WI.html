<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications.</p>
