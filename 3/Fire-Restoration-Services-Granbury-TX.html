<p>Deterioration is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of products (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you integrate electricity, oxygen, metal and water, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal elements generally start corroding instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can work generally for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How fast the rust process takes depends on a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
