<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show noticeable indications of moisture, dripping water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may crumble or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster material.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
