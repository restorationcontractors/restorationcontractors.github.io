<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
