<p>Learn how to get rid of black mold securely and effectively. Make sure to don adequate protective equipment if you choose to manage the mold removal yourself. The CDC recommends that you wear long pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and glasses, water resistant boots, and a mask rated a minimum of N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth. Keep in mind that while these masks protect you from small particles like mold, they are not appropriate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
