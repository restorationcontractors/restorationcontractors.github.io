There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.
