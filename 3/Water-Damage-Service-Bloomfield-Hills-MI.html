If there is a lot of mold growth, seek advice from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".

<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
