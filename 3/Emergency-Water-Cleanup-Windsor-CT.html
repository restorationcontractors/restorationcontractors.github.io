In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is finished.<p>
