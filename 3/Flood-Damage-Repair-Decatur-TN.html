<p>Current Review: We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job appropriately. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>For safety factors, they also determine the kind of water they're handling before starting the water restoration cleanup process. You might attempt powering your phone on at this moment to evaluate the damage, however we recommend taking a further step prior to running the risk of turning the phone on. Immerse your phone in a desiccant-- a substance that will induce dryness by taking in water. That's simply an expensive method of saying, grab the rice.<p>
