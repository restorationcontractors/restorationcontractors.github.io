<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Even when you consist of a small indoor fire, smoke damage can happen. That's because fire is a noticeable combustion of light and heat, and most people understand how to consist of a fire.
