<p>Removing among the 3 requirements for mold lowers (or eliminates) brand-new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat given that mold typically does not grow in cold environments.

I would certainly suggest for any mitigation or restoration work you require.<p>
<p>But you may not be able to get insurance coverage to pay for your mold remediation expenses if the damage is a result of your neglect-- for instance, if you've had a slow leakage under your bathroom sink for many years and have actually disregarded the problem.
