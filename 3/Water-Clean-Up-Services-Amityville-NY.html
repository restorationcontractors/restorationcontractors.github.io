Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
