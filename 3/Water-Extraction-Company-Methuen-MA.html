<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
