<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion throughout wet surface areas of assemblies or products is an important element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Rapid air motion across the surface area of product ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness gives way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The most significant step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration involves changing materials like drywall and insulation. In some cases this procedure is as simple as setting up a few panels of drywall, while severe cases might need changing entire walls. Exposure to toxic compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older homes are likely to contain these compounds.</p>
