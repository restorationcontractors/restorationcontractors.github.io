<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>

Water intrusion where damp, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), textiles) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have soaked up very little moisture.</p>

These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
