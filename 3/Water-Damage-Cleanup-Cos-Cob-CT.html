<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. There is a fantastic video below that I encourage you to watch. We encountered it while assisting a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not only does it do a fantastic task of showing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the creator also demonstrates how to repair the damage action by action. Now this repair was carried out in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, however the principles still apply even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass exterior.</p>
<p>A pipe burst in my crawlspace, triggering significant water build-up. Colby and Caleb showed up on the scene within a number of hours and continued to drain pipes the location before any damage was done to my home.

<h3>Water Damaged Ceiling in Cos Cob Connecticut</h2>
<p>If there are dark areas on your ceiling, floorings or walls, this is a sure indication of mold growth. Moldy odors and mildew are typically indications that mold might be growing in your house. Breathing and allergy symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, problem breathing and wheezing are a common indication of mold development also. Likewise, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surface areas are an indication of mold.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes.</p>
