<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

A few of the mold on the surface might be killed but the roots of the mold are left undamaged suggesting the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated whitening. Maybe this is why some individuals think that spraying bleach on mold doesn't affect it however instead just bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
