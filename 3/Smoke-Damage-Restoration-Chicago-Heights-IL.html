<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore protection, and cover arms, hands and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the moldy location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will minimize the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning.

Make sure it will not discolor the material or surface area if you utilize bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a neighboring exit instead of the main home, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>

<p>Food sources for mold in structures consist of cellulose-based materials such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and raw material such as soap, materials, and dust including skin cells.
