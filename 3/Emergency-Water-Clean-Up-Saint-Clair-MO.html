<h3>Flood Remediation & Repair Saint Clair MO 63077</h3>
<p>Dehumidification - Once the water has been eliminated, we then implement action three of your water damage restoration strategy.

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation procedure is considered to finish.<p>
