<p>Vapor pressure is straight related to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and humidity). As heat is applied to a product, energy is added. Raising the temperature of a wet material increases the rate of evaporation, more releasing moisture from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference in between ambient temperature and dew point temperature level, the higher the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>

<p>Also, considering that bleach is mainly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly soaked up by the material. So, while you might have rubbed out or discolored the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact provided a lot of water to grow back and perhaps spread the mold beneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, speak with the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be required.<p>
