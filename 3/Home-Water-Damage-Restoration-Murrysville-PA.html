<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his people were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and also were very handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
