<p>When you are preparing big repairs, keep in mind that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
