<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
