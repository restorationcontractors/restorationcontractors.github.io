These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout numerous days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
