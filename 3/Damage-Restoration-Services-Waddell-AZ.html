<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Negative air devices, geared up with HEPA (high performance particulate air filters") ought to be used to remove bacteria and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage must be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with appropriate waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of correctly. Tough surface areas that are affected must be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard ought to be removed and appropriately disposed of. Any material that absorbs significant amounts of wetness and can not be sufficiently cleaned up must be eliminated. Once infected materials have been eliminated, a 2nd application of sanitizers ought to be used to all work surfaces.</p>
