<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
