<p>When you are planning large repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is finished.<p>
