<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Granite City - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold specialists typically advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the option on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water easily. This might worsen the problem because as you understand - mold enjoys damp environments.<p>
