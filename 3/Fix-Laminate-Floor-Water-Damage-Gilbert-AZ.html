<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is essential to identify if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit.

The greater the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
