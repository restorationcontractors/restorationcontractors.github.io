<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at threat of mold growth. Drooping or moldy walls. Any significant sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is an indication that you need water damage repair services. Drywall 1 sags when saturated with water. Seeing visible mold on the walls is another sign, however not everyone notices mold within their homes. Prior to mold lies, you may smell a distinct moldy fragrance or experience allergic reaction symptoms due to mold exposure. These odors are particularly pungent in areas like the basement. The foul odor resembles the scent of damp, mildewy laundry. Unfortunately, it's not unusual for house owners to error mold development for dirt.</p>

<p>Many mold infestations start out little, and may go undetected if they are inside a crawl area, duct, or other inconspicuous area. For that reason, your first indication of a mold infestation may be a moldy odor. Other signs consist of staining on the ceilings or walls and visible mold development on walls and other surface areas. If you have a boost in allergy signs happening inside, this may also be a sign of a mold invasion.</p>

<p>Many highly contagious health problems are connected to water damage consisting of skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's illness, in addition to blood, kidney, and liver issues. Some of the mold on the surface might be killed but the roots of the mold are left intact suggesting the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of duplicated whitening. Maybe this is why some people think that spraying bleach on mold does not affect it but instead simply whitens its color so you can no longer see it.<p>
