Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The biggest action in the process is restoration. Restoration involves replacing materials like drywall and insulation. Often this process is as simple as setting up a few panels of drywall, while serious cases might require replacing whole walls.
