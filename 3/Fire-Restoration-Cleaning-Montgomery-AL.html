<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

You can even send us a photograph of the mold in your house if you identify it on permeable surface areas such as a drywall, curio or wood , and request for complimentary guidance.</p>
