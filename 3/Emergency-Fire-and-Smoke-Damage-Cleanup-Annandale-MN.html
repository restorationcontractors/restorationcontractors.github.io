To clean mold utilizing borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the service on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall.
