<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a wide area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
