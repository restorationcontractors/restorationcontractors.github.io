<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Sagging or moldy walls.

The nasty smell resembles the scent of damp, mildewy laundry. Sadly, it's not unusual for homeowners to error mold development for dirt.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you really wish to avoid purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and wipe it straight over mold development. Let the service sit for as much as 10 minutes, and then scrub the area with a small brush or toothbrush. Wipe any staying mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>
