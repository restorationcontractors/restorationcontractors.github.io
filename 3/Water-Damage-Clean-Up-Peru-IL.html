<p>Open doors and windows to eliminate moisture and odors if the weather condition allows. If the outside humidity ends up being greater than within, close things up; also, close up your house overnight if temperature levels drop and moist air may otherwise be drawn indoors. If windows are stuck tight, remove window strips and get rid of entire sash. If doors are stuck, eliminate door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then eliminate.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the damp desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperature levels.</p>

Some materials will take on more water than others, and some materials can be more challenging to dry. Do not hesitate to ask our service professionals daily to show you the progress we are making in the drying process.
