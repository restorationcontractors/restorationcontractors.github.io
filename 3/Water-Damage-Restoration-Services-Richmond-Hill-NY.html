<p>Indoor mold growth can generally be seen or smelled. In many cases, if noticeable mold development is present, sampling is not required. There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can utilize to examine a mold tasting result. The Florida Department of Health does not recommend mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold problem, or to see what sort of mold may be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be costly and, if done, should only be done by knowledgeable experts. Investigate a mold issue; do not test</p>

First, remove dampness by installing a dehumidifier and making certain the dryer vent exhausts externally, if you use your basement for laundry.
