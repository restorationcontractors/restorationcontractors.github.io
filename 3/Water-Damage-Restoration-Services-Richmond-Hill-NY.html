<p>Indoor mold growth can generally be seen or smelled. In many cases, if noticeable mold development is present, sampling is not required. There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can utilize to examine a mold tasting result.

First, remove dampness by installing a dehumidifier and making certain the dryer vent exhausts externally, if you use your basement for laundry.
