<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the place the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen upkeep, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.
