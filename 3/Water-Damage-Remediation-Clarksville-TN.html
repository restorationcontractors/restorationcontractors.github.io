Moldy odors can stick around in a home where leakages or flooding have actually taken place and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>

Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
