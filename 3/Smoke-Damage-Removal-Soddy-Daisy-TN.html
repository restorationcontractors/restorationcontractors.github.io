<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. When InstaScope was developed, we engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was assigned to validate and test the new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for industrial consumers that, unlike any other method or device, can deliver scientifically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so immediately. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help make sure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>

<h3>Basement Water Problems in Soddy Daisy Tennessee</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be much more humid than above-ground levels and usually have poor ventilation and little air flow, a combination that can trigger mold to thrive. And of course, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather condition or unnoticed leaks in the pipes or sump pump. In addition, once mold establishes, cinder block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Food sources for mold in buildings consist of cellulose-based products such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and raw material such as soap, fabrics, and dust consisting of skin cells. If a house has mold, the wetness might come from the basement or crawl space, a dripping roof or a leakage in plumbing pipelines. Inadequate ventilation might speed up moisture buildup. Noticeable mold colonies might form where ventilation is poorest and on border walls (because they are nearest the humidity ).</p>
