It may be covered by insurance coverage when a product currently covered under your house owners insurance breaks accidentally-- for example, if your pipes all of a sudden ruptures and water floods your home, the homeowners insurance will cover part or all of the costs for the plumbing repair and any mold remediation costs needed as a direct result of the water damage.<p>
