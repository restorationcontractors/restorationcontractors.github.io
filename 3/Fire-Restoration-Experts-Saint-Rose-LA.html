<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction between the oxygen that exists in the atmosphere and a source of combustible fuel. Once this combustible fuel - carpet, drywall, or furnishings - has actually been heated to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will ignite and unstable gases will be released in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause long lasting damage and must be dealt with by skilled professionals, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, product of this chain reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - indicating that as a fire comes into contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is finished.<p>
