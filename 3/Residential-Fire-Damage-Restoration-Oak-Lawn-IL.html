Did you understand that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears.

<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
<h3>Water & Fire Damage Repair‎ in Oak Lawn</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
