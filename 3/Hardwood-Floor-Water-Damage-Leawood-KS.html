<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from tough surface areas, and repair leaky faucets as quickly as possible. Always make certain your tableware and serving meals are dry before storing them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as quickly as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to prevent it from spreading out.</p>
