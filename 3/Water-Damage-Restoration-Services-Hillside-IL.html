<h2>Flood Damage After Large and Small Disasters in Hillside</h2>

<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any situation, particularly when the hot water heater unit is located inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater impends unless fixed quickly, and the expenses go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The offender may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
