<h3>Fire Damage Clean Up in Irvington</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health risk and must be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
