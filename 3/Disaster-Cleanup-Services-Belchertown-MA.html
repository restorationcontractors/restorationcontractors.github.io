Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.<p>

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient because it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Once the meters check out wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.
