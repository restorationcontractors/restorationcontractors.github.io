<p>Since typical structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
