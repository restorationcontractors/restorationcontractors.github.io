Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.<p>
