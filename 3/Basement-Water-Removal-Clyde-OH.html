<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can take place by itself if a fire is contained. A number of hundred claims submitted in the last five years declare that most of these houses consist of dozens of offenses of the state-mandated building code that ultimately enabled water to drain into both brand-new and renovated houses. Numerous homes with water damage lack standard weatherproofing materials, assessment reports state. Coats of stucco are often too thin. According to a claim by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, workmanship was so poor that, even prior to the household moved in, a mushroom sprouted in the floorboard of their 20-month-old child's bedroom.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate kitchen area maintenance, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning.
