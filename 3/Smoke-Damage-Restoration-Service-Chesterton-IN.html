<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
