If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and must be removed.

This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
