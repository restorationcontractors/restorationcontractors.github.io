<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any modifications.</p>
