<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Not to complicate the matter, however to add some clearness to the concern of mold, mold spores are dangerous. They threaten whether alive or dead. So mold removal is different than mold cleaning.
