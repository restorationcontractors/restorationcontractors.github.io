<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>When a fire or smoke damage has actually taken place in a home or company, there is a lot that has to be dealt with in the aftermath. Understanding what to do and how to do things is important in appropriately alleviating the damage that has occurred. After a lot of fires there will be smoke and fire damage but also generally water damage Denver also. We have had the experience handling nearly every type of fire and know what is necessary to bring things back to normalcy. When addressing a fire and or smoke damage, we follow a number of steps.</p>

<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a known irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at eliminating air-borne mold or surface mold contamination. Even if mold was eliminated by ozone, the health risks would not be minimized up until mold pollutants are eliminated through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not suggest the use of ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
