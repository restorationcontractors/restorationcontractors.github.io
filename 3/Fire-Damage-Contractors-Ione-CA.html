<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Throughout a water loss emergency, nearly every location of your Seattle home could be at threat for damage. Moving water and moisture can penetrate porous surface areas and contents, which can change their look and cause irreversible damage within the very first 2 days of direct exposure. It is crucial for restoration and recovery efforts to get started as quickly as possible to better secure these affected locations and products in your home.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache because the gypsum drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.

However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with full sheets.
