<p>3. Eliminate Mold Development - Your approach depends upon the type of product or surface infected. Mold spores are all over. A kind of fungus that provides in a thread-like structure, mold prevails and can be found in almost every part of the world. When mold begins to grow inside the home, the problem arises. This is generally due to the fact that the mold spores have actually discovered their method to a wet location where conditions are right for them to begin to grow.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Visual: You may see that all mold is gone is away, but hidden mold colonies and mold spores can stick around in surprise locations and in the air.
