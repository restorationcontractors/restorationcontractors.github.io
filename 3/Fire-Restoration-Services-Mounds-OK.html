<p>The expense of electrical usage for our devices is typically less than individuals believe.

These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which implies that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days.
