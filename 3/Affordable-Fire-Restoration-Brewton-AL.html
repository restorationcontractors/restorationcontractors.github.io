<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were fantastic in assisting us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
