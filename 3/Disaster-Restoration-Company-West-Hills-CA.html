<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a dangerous scenario for property owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's experienced plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is fixed.

When the soil is saturated or flooded, those hazardous materials can go into the groundwater and your drinking water supply.</p>
