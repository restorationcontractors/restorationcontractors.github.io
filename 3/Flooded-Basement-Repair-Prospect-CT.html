<p>These factors influence the movement of moisture within a material along with the evaporation rate from the surface of the material and can greatly affect the general drying. time for a job. It is very important to rapidly manage the wetness in the air and use enough airflow to dry the surface of materials to reduce water activity, thus lowering the capacity for microbial growth.

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up.
