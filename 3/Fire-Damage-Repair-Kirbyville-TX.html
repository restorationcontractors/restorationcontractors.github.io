<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
