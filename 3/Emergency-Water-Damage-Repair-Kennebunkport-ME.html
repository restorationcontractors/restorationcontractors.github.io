<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
