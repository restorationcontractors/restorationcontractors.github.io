<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on walls and floors is another potential result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>First Action Disaster Cleanup is Seattle's leading disaster restoration company that uses fast, 24-hour action, trained and experienced technicians, and direct insurance billing. The company supplies expert service for flooding and sewage system backups, and crews of qualified personnel rapidly remove water and contaminated materials, dry and dehumidify structures and valuables, and repair or replace damaged floor covering, drywall, and framing. Emergency service is readily available for fire and smoke damage, and the company offers shingle, window, and roof repairs after serious storms and hail.</p>

It was first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Gypsum Corporation put out a product called Sheetrock" indicated to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering. Since it went up quickly without the need for wood lathe, the product was billed as the poor man's answer to plaster walls" By the 1950s and 60s, drywall had actually ended up being a basic building product.</p>
