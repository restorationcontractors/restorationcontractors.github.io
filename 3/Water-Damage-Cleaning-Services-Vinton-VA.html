These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days.
