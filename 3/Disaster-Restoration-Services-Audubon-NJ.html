<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, rapid air motion throughout wet surface areas of assemblies or products is a vital part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies. Rapid air movement throughout the surface area of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface area moisture gives way to reducing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all affected surface areas starts next. Antimicrobial and antifungal cleansers are used on any tough surfaces to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are normally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eradicated, generally involving deep cleaning with an antifungal or antimicrobial  cleanser.</p>
