As discussed, fast air movement throughout wet surface areas of materials or assemblies is a vital element of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products.

A lot of phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has damaged the device. You can attempt to draw the wetness out by submerging the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product over night. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you don't hold the vacuum too near the gadget.

At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
