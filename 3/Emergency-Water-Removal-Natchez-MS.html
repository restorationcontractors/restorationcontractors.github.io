Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products.

At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The greater the dew point rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
