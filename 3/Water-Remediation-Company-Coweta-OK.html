<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Often it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may crumble or droop under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous plaster product. Other times, you may notice little indications like coffee-colored spots that may broaden in time.</p>

Anything larger should be connected to the ceiling joists in order to firmly hold the spot's weight in addition to any insulation above it.</p>
