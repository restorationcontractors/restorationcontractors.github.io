<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Wear a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore security, and cover arms, legs and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the musty location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use industrial black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any surrounding locations. If you utilize bleach, make sure it won't discolor the product or surface. Place all sponges, devices and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a nearby exit instead of the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>

Make sure that you get to the origin of the molds and you should open the walls to discover them. Scrub the surface areas with a mold cleaner and do this thoroughly.
