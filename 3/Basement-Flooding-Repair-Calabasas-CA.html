Experts have actually labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted sprawling rural houses, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics constructed with materials aside from stucco had issues, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local firms. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was easy: It was an ideal storm"-- a mix that lawyers now allege came from pressure to develop faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rains is around 41 inches-- and the capacity for water damage was that much higher.</p>
