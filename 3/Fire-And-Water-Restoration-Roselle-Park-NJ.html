<p>Since mold and mildew can be a major health hazard, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material ought to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>After you learn how to get rid of mold, focus on preventing it in the future. Controlling dampness is the essential to stopping most mold. The worst infestations generally take place in moist crawl areas, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with bad foundation drainage. Stopping leakages, ensuring good ventilation in attics, keeping crawl areas dry and routing water away from the foundation are the very best defenses against mold.</p>
