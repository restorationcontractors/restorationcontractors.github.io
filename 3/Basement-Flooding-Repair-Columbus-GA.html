An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any scenario, particularly when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The perpetrator might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>

<p>Advanced Structural Drying (ASD) is the effective, efficient drying of water-damaged buildings and residences, utilizing thorough understanding and tools. The process includes the collection of proper data for utilization and application of technical and clinical principles.

In many cases, ASD utilizes more equipment to speed up drying, thus reducing expenses, time, and the inconvenience associated to replacement and repairs.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for each two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
