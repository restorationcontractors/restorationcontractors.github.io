<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>
