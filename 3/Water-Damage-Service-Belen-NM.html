<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's salts and minerals instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
