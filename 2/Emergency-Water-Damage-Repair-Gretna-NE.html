<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As mentioned, fast air motion across wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a critical element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air motion throughout the surface of material ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture gives way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for changing conditions.</p>
