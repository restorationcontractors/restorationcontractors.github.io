<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job effectively. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

Place water-permeable plans of desiccants and damp items in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets. Some desiccants change color to show they are saturated, which can take weeks or days, depending upon just how much wetness products consist of.<p>
