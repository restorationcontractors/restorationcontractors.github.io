<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
