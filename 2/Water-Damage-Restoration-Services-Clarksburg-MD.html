<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most successful water damage restoration tasks begin with an extensive extraction; our exclusive extraction equipment will start things off on the ideal foot. We will then offer you with a drying plan and the proper equipment to finish the procedure. We invest heavily in the most updated drying devices to control the drying process. Advanced inspection tools will verify the drying process and even help in locating any hidden pockets of water.</p>
