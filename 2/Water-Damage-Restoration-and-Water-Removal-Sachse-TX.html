<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
