<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape requires some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to complete.<p>
