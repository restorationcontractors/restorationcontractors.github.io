<p>Indoor mold development can generally be seen or smelled. Most of the times, if visible mold development exists, sampling is not required. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can utilize to evaluate a mold tasting result. The Florida Department of Health does not suggest mold testing or tasting to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what type of mold might be growing. Sampling for mold in the air can be expensive and, if done, should only be done by experienced specialists. Examine a mold problem; don't test</p>
<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly during this process in order to guarantee the solution remains well mixed.)

Unless water discolorations appear, this wetness might go undetected until molds and smell problems happen.
