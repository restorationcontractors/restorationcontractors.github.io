<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
