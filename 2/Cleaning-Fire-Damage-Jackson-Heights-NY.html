<p>Any structure that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another possible effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering may need replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Musty smells can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this might be indicative of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
