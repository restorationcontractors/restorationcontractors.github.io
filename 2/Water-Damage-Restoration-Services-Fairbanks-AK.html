<p>Places that are typically or always damp can be difficult to maintain totally devoid of mold. If there's some mold in the shower or elsewhere in the bathroom that appears to come back, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more frequently will normally prevent mold from recurring, or at least keep the mold to a minimum. We can provide you with extra services if you require them in addition to your restoration work, including plumbing, general contracting, electrical, and air conditioning and heating.<p>
