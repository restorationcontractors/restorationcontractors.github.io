The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to examine which drying devices or techniques will be the most reliable. It is imperative to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several structure products and how they react to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The greater the number, the faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
