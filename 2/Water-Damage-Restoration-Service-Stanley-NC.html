<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Stanley</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
