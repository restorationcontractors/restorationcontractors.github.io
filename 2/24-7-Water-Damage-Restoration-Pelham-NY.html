The perpetrator may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that lawyers now declare came from pressure to construct faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and contractor oversight.
