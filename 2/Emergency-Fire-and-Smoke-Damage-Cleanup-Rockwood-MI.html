<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job correctly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Notice that your house is flooded? Do not lose time, and call a specialist instantly. A flooded home is not something that you can repair yourself if you have no experience with the circumstance. Call a water damage restoration company that can completely evaluate the extent of the damage, and can use the best strategy. Do not even consider taking a hair clothes dryer to your handset. Added heat could trigger deterioration if there is any water on your phone's hardware. Rather, begin with a soft, microfiber cloth, the kind you use to clean spots off of your glasses. If you can remove the back panel of your phone, utilize a cloth to wipe down the components inside.<p>
<p>Get rid of any wall hangings, like photographs, if a location has actually sustained water damage. Keep them in a safe, dry location till they can be gone back to the walls. Wipe down the walls, too, to alleviate excess wetness. Craig: Kitchen problems. You now see water leakages and moldy smells with the windows and doors closed. A normal problem is a dripping waterline connected to a dishwashing machine, fridge or sink .<p>
