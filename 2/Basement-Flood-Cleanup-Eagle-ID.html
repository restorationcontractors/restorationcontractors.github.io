<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
