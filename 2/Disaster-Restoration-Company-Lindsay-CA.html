<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floors is another prospective effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending upon the degree of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have actually happened and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
