Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he found out just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful individual.</p>
