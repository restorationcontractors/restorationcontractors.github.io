<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold safely and effectively. Burst or damaged pipelines can be a major headache when you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from. Sprinkler line pipe burst typically goes undetected till the water comes hurrying through basement window wells and walls triggering substantial basement water damage. A pipe burst in the attic can lead to gallons of water drizzling down on the rooms inside your home.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the answer was simple: It was a best storm"-- a mix that attorneys now allege originated from pressure to develop quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost building materials, and little federal government and home builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the typical yearly rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
