<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>After storms and other weather-related disasters, homeowners frequently discover themselves besieged by unreliable, fly-by-night repair services. To prevent that issue, look for reliable water damage restoration companies with excellent referrals from local customers such as your next-door neighbors and good friends. Also, consider where the company is located, due to the fact that in your area owned and run companies are more likely to rely on the word of mouth created by providing trustworthy, extensive repair work.</p>

As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be gotten rid of to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
