<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
