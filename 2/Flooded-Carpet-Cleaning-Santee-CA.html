<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a household or company can experience. Soot is the effect of wood and other fuels not being entirely taken in by flames. Throughout a fire, soot increases as fine particles of carbon and trace chemical substances.

Raised exposure can also take place if people directly deal with musty materials or unintentionally consume mold.</p>
