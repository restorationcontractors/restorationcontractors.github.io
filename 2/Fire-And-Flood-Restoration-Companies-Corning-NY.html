Wear long sleeves and pants to safeguard your skin. You should also use gloves and eye security.

If the damaged area is little, you can most likely get away with just covering furnishings with plastic or sheets.

Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you do not track soot spots into other spaces.<p>
<p>Deodorization: In regards to deodorization, we use either ozone devices, which can only be used when the property is entirely vacant for a prolonged time, or hydroxyl units.

Often, the system will be set closest to the reason for the fire to be most effective.<p>
