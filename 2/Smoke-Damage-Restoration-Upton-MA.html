The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working.

If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
