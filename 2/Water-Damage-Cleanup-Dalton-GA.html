<p>Since one of the significant after-effectses of flood damage is mold invasion, why you would need Dallas mold removal is. If a residence or a business home has just recently suffered water damage and therefore mold growth-- which is a kind of fungus-- it can quickly spread throughout the property in 24-48 hours.
