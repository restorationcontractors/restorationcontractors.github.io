<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most disastrous things that can occur to a household or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being totally replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard may need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might need changing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The type of wood floor covering you might have figures out and limits the type of repairs that need to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a wider series of choices to fix the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
