<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to get the job done appropriately.
