When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
