<p>Jake (and his group) are incredible to deal with. They were quick to react initially and provided a fair and sensible  quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule promptly and get the work done extremely quickly. Our mold concern ended up being smaller than first believed so the last invoice reflected the actual work required and was less than first estimated. Jake was very responsive to e-mails and calls addressing concerns throughout the process. All in all, I had an excellent experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>

<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in South Saint Paul</h3>
<p>I experienced water damage in my home, from the upstairs ceiling down the walls. I discovered First Reaction online, and they were out within the hour. It was a harsh experience, however whatever they did for me was great. When they were offering me problems, they finest thing about First Action was that they were able to handle my insurance coverage company. This most likely assisted me out the most. Brent, the owner, stepped right in and dealt with the problem for me, which was a substantial relief. They were very professional, and I liked everyone I dealt with from the company. They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my fulfillment. I would use them again.<p>
