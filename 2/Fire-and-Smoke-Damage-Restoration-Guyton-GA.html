<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most destructive things that can happen to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being totally replaced. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard might need fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you may have identifies and limits the type of repairs that need to happen. Strong hardwood flooring allows for a larger series of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface.
