<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
