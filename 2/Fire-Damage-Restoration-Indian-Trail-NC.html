They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.
