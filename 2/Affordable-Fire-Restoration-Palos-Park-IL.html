<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish degeneration of materials (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently called rust). There is no reputable timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components normally begin corroding immediately after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can operate usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of a problem. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
