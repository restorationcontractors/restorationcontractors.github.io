Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous person.</p>
