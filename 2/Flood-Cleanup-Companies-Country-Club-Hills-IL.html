<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to complete.<p>
