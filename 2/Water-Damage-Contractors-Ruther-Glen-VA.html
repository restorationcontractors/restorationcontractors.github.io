<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Ruther Glen</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts generally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly. This could intensify the issue due to the fact that as you understand - mold likes damp environments.<p>
