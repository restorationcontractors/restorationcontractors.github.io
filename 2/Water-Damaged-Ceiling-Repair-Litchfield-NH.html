<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion throughout damp surfaces of products or assemblies is an important component of successfully and efficiently drying the surface of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies.

The consistent and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
