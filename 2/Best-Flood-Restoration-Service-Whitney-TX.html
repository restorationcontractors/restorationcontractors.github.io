Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leak started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.
