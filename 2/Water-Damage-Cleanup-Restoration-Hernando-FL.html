The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or approaches will be the most efficient. It is important to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to several building materials and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
