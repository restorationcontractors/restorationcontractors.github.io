Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.</p>
