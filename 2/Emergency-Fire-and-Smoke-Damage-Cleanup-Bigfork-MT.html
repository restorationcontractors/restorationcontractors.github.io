Few residential or commercial property disasters have the instant and harmful effect as fire. Fire damage, smoke damage, smoke smell, and fire soot residue left on a residential or commercial property and its contents can overwhelm resident and company owner.<p>
<p>However you might not be able to get insurance to pay for your mold remediation expenses if the damage is an outcome of your disregard-- for example, if you've had a sluggish leak under your bathroom sink for many years and have actually ignored the concern. If the insurer can identify that the mold damage is a result of your negligence, they likely won't cover mold remediation costs. Your homeowner's insurance likely will not cover the loss if you do not have flood insurance. If the flood has been declared a federal disaster by the President, obtain assistance online at or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA( 3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired.<p>
