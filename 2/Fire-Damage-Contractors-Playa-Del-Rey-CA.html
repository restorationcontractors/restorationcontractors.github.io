<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a family or service can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
