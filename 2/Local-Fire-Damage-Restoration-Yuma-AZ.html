<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest action in the procedure is restoration. Restoration involves replacing products like drywall and insulation.

<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and humidity). As heat is applied to a material, energy is added. Raising the temperature of a damp material increases the rate of evaporation, more releasing moisture from the product and altering the internal vapor pressure. The greater the distinction in between ambient temperature and humidity temperature, the higher the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>
<p>Because mold and mildew can be a serious health threat, it's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to get rid of approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
