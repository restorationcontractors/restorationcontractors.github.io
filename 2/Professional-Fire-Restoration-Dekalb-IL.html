<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health danger and must be gotten rid of if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
