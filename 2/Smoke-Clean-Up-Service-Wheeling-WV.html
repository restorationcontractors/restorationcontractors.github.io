<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the damp desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up. When wet inbound air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process soaks up moisture without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily run listed below freezing temperature levels.</p>
<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke spots. This stage is necessary, as these sponges utilize special chemicals to raise discolorations from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water prior to you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're always using a clean surface. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surfaces below. Or simply grab a new sponge. Make sure you use a cleaning motion the entire time. If you scrub the stains, you may spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface area.</p>
