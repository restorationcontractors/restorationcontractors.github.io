The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
