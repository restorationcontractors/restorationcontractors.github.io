<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
