<p>Negative air devices, geared up with HEPA (high performance particle air filters") need to be used to get rid of bacteria and other contaminants from the air during restoration work.

Hard surface areas that are affected must be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard ought to be removed and appropriately disposed of. Any material that absorbs substantial quantities of wetness and can not be adequately cleaned ought to be eliminated. When infected products have actually been gotten rid of, a 2nd application of sanitizers must be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
