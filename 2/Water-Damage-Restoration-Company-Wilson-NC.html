<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you really wish to prevent acquiring a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this solution and wipe it straight over mold development. Let the service sit for up to 10 minutes, and then scrub the area with a small brush or tooth brush. Wipe any remaining mold away with a towel and let the location dry.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold as it is anti-fungal as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial.
