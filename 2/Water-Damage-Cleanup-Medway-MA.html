<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
