<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Water damage can permanently damage your home or company. The longer you wait, the greater the possibilities of mold causing health risks. When handling water damage, it is crucial to act immediately.
