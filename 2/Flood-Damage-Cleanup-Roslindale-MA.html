<p>To get rid of soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floorings, use a mild soap or cleaning agent or blend together 4 to 6 tbsp. tri-sodium phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach to every gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves. Make certain to rinse surface areas with clear warm water and dry thoroughly. Now, if you are an experienced tech specialist of sorts and know the ins and outs of a phone, and do not mind running the risk of voiding your service warranty, you can go on and take the whole phone apart too. It might help with drying up each and every single piece much faster. Just be careful, if you don't know what you're doing this could cause more harm than good.<p>
