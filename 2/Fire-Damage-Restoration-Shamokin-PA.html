<p>Because common building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
