<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his guys were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
