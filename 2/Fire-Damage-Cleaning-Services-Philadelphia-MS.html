Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days.
