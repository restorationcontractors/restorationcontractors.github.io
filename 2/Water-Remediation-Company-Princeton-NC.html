Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects.

While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
