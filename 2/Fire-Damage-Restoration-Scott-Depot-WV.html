<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leatherlike and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Search for indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has dripped for months and gone without repairs, mold can grow as an outcome, but it will not be covered by your property owners insurance.

Should you send a claim for mold damage, this cause would be assessed and identified by the flood insurance adjuster.</p>
