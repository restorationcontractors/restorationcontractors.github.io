HEPA air scrubbers eliminate pollutants from the air. This is a particularly important piece of fire damage restoration devices, as lingering soot particles can result in health problems in a structure's residents after a fire. Industrial air scrubbers are also crucial in mold remediation when filtering mold spores from the polluted environment.

<p>Since typical building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
