These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
