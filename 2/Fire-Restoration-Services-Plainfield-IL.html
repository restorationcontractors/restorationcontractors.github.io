<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide.

There is no trustworthy schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal parts typically start wearing away instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate typically for days or weeks without showing any obvious sign of a problem.
