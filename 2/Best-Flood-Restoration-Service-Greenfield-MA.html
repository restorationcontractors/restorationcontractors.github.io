<p>Class 3 - greatest amount of water, evaporation, and absorption. Water invasion where damp, porous products (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in very little moisture.</p>

So get to work, but not without gloves, eye security, a facemask, and a respirator to keep smoke particles off your skin and out of your lungs.</p>
<p>Next use the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to clean the soot and smoke stains. This phase is essential, as these sponges use unique chemicals to raise discolorations from walls. Never utilize soot cleaner or water prior to you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread out the soot and make it impossible to remove with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a various side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces beneath. Or just get a brand-new sponge. Ensure you use a wiping movement the whole time. You might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the stains.</p>
