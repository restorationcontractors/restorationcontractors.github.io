<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
