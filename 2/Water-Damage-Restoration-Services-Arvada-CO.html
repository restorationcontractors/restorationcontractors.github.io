<p>Smoke damage is a common adverse effects of fire damage, but it can take place by itself if a fire is contained.

<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache due to the fact that the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag before drying, fixing it might just require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
