<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Smoke damage is a common adverse effects of fire damage, but it can take place on its own if a fire is contained.

Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.
