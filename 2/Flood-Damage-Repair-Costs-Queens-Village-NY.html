<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Queens Village</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
