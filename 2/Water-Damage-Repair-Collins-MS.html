We focus on cleaning and repairing residential or commercial properties that have suffered fire damage and work toward safeguarding and securing your home from more damage.

<p>Smoke-damaged books and documents are usually disposed of. Internal Revenue Service Restoration reclaims paper items through a process of freeze drying to get rid of lingering smoke smells. Whatever that entered into contact with flood water will need to be disinfected. You should discard any porous materials it touched and make sure everything else is thoroughly sterilized if the water included sewage or other dangerous products. Do this as soon as possible to prevent mold development.<p>
<p>After we evaluate the storm and check damage, we start immediately on water removal, as water will continue to soak into the floorings, walls, furniture, and other locations of the home with each passing minute.
