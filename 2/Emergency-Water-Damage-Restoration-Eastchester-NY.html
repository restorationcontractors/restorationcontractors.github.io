<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Black mold can be unsafe to your health, primarily triggering breathing concerns. However in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you may wish to purchase a mold testing kit to see what kind of mold spores you're dealing with, and employ a specialist to assist with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you most likely already have on-hand) that will help remove mold.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
