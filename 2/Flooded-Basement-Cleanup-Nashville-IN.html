<p>Deterioration is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and slow wear and tear of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no dependable timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal components generally start wearing away right away after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the deterioration procedure takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
