<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is damp and great, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surface areas starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are utilized on any hard surfaces to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be removed, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are generally brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eliminated, generally including deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>

<p>After removing the damaged drywall, determine the size of the hole so you can eliminate a spot from a new sheet of drywall. Place 4 drywall clips around the hole.

Eliminate the patch and insert it, then protect it to the drywall clips (and readily available ceiling joists) using drywall screws. Take care not to over-tighten.<p>
