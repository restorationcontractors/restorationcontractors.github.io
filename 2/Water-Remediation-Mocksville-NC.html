<p>As the job progresses and the environment is supported, products can be dried by handling the humidity, energy, and airflow (heat). Further into the drying, air movement need to be re-directed and make sure good transfer of energy to the staying wet areas. The total need for humidity control and airflow can be lower than at the beginning of the task because there is significantly less wetness in products being evaporated during the latter stage.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any modifications.</p>
<p>Devices utilized in mold remediation includes: wetness meter: measures drying of damaged products; Humidity gauge: often paired with a thermometer; borescope: Electronic camera at the end of a flexible snake, illuminating possible mold problems inside walls, ceilings and crawl spaces; digital cam: Files findings throughout assessment; personal protective devices (PPE): Respirators, gloves, invulnerable fit, and eye security; thermographic electronic camera: Infrared thermal-imaging video cameras identify secondary wetness sources.</p>
