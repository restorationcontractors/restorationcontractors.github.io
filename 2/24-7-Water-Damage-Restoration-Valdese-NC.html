<p>Find out how to remove black mold safely and effectively. Make sure to don adequate protective equipment if you choose to manage the mold removal yourself. The CDC recommends that you use long pants and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and eyeglasses, waterproof boots, and a mask ranked at least N-95 or more to protect your nose and mouth. Note that while these masks secure you from little particles like mold, they are not sufficient if you are experiencing any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
