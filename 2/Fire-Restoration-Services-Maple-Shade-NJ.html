<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have actually labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration stage of the project, your experienced cleanup team will use the proper mix of cleaning representatives, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers.
