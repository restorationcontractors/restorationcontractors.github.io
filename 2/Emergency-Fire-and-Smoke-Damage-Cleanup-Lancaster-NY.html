<p>Don't presume your property owners insurance will pay to fix your mold problems. Insurance coverage normally pays if the issue arises from an emergency currently covered on your policy, like a burst pipeline, but not if mold arised from delayed maintenance, relentless moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance). It's important NOT to take a knee jerk reaction if you experience water damage. It's best to call your insurer instantly. Picking the restoration company is completely decided by the home owner.<p>
<p>Lots of extremely contagious illnesses are linked to water damage including skin infections, hepatitis A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's illness, as well as kidney, liver, and blood concerns.
