<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Special, professional-grade devices is required to bring back smoke damage. It also takes an unique understanding of where smoke can penetrate, the sources of smoke odor, and the best cleaning and restoration method for particular surfaces and materials. Even more, good restoration teams will understand how to take on the different varieties of smoke, including damp, dry, and fuel-oil smoke. Each of these needs different tools and techniques to eliminate or repair the damage.</p>

Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical level of sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a wet cloth and a moderate detergent, so we recommend the least poisonous option.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>

Our heatpump low-grain dehumidifiers are used to get rid of wetness - a silent, yet durable contributor to chronic structural and content damage.
