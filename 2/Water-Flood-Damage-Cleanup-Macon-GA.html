<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the steady and sluggish deterioration of materials (usually metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you integrate electricity, oxygen, metal and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally start rusting instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue.
