<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any scenario, especially when the water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's utilized on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also gives off severe fumes and it even produces poisonous gas when blended with ammonia. There are safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave poisonous residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you should utilize it, only use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
