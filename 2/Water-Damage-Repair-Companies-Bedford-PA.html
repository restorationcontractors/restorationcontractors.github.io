This removes the opportunity that the phone will short circuit, and need to be fixed. As you can see, time is of the essence when dealing with a water damage event.<p>
<p>The time it takes for the mold removal process depends upon numerous factors such as just how much mold exists, where the mold is growing (behind walls, and so on), and the products it grows on.
