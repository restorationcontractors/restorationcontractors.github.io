Water intrusion where damp, permeable products (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where materials referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have soaked up very little moisture.</p>
<p>Thoroughly shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating service, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle consistently throughout this process in order to guarantee the service remains well blended.) Allow the liquid to rest on the mold for 5 to 10 minutes so the anti-bacterial properties have time to resolve the gunk. Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the hazardous spores might spread out into air and trigger unfavorable health impacts.</p>
