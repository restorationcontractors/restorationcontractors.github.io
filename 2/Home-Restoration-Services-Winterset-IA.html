<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any situation, specifically when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your water heater looms unless repaired rapidly, and the costs increase the longer the issue goes uncorrected.

<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for lots of major problems that can affect a building, damage personal effects and present severe health threats to occupants.
