Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the hazardous spores might spread out into air and cause unfavorable health impacts.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment.
