Start cleaning the walls carefully with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're always utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces below. Or merely grab a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a wiping motion the whole time.
