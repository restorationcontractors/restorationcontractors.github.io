Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>The very best remediation is done by a mold assessor who confirms the existence of a mold problem needing action and the extent of damage then composes a clear scope of work consisting of relevant standards.
