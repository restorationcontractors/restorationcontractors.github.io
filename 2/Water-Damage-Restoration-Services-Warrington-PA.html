<p>Remove the gadget from the water as quickly as possible, and remove the battery instantly. Eliminating the battery rapidly could make the distinction to save your phone.

You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too close to the gadget. Often cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water long.</p>
