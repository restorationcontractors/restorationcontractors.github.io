<p>Since typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
