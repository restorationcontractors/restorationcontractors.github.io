<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
