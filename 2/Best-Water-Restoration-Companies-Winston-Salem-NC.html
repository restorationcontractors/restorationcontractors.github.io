The Florida Department of Health does not suggest mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold issue, or to see what type of mold may be growing.

<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Winston Salem</h3>
<p>Once you've identified the upseting growth, work up a mold-fighting option. While lots of agents can battle mold (Borax, bleach, vinegar, and ammonia, among others), tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract are typically considered the most reliable items to decontaminate and deodorize the problem area. Furthermore, they're completely non-toxic. You can buy tea tree oil online and in health shops; just ensure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) and that its active components include 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no greater than 10 to 15 percent cineole.
