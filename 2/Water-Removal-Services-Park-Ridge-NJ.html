<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most destructive things that can occur to a family or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being fully changed. If there is minor damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need fixing. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may require changing and sometimes even the subfloor too. The sort of wood flooring you might have restricts the type and identifies of repair work that need to take place. Strong hardwood flooring allows for a larger variety of options to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for private slabs. The best method to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
