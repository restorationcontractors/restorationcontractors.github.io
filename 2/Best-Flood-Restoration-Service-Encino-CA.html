Our heat pump low-grain dehumidifiers are used to remove wetness - a silent, yet durable contributor to persistent structural and content damage. How available a water damaged space is and the materials included likewise play important roles in identifying the rate of water mitigation and the subsequent restoration process.<p>
<p>In more advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: major leakage or radiant floor heating leakage), fixing the subfloor may even be required.
