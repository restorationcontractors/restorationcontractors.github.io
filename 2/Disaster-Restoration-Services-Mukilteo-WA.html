This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really costly paperweight.</p>
