<p>Cleanup: During the cleaning and restoration stage of the task, your skilled cleanup group will use the proper mix of cleaning agents, air cleaning devices, and deodorizers.

<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going person.</p>
