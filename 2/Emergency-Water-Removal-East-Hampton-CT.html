<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals generally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold vanishes. There's no need to wash it off since borax will keep the mold from returning. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such products soak up water quickly. This could exacerbate the problem since as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>
