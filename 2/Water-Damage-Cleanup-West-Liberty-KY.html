<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens.

Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
