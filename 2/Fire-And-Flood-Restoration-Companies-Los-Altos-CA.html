<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>In many cases, labor charges are figured out by the size of the afflicted area. Water cleanup teams examine the location and calculate cleanup efforts based upon square footage. Costs for clean water and gray water cleanup are the lowest, between $4 and $4.75 per square foot 5 Black water cleanup jobs will be the most costly at $7.25, on average, per square foot 5 For a 300 room, expect to pay in between $1,500 and $2,500. If the company charges a per hour rate for water damage restoration services, the charge is around $75 per hour. Special situations, such as debris removal, increase the average labor rate with surcharges of $200 or more.</p>
