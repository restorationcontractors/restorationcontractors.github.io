<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
