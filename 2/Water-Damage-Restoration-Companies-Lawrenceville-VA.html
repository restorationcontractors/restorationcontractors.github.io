<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a household or a person. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being totally changed. Then the majority of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard might need fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor might require replacing and in some cases even the subfloor also. The sort of wood floor covering you might have limits the type and determines of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood flooring allows for a broader range of choices to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for private planks. The best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
