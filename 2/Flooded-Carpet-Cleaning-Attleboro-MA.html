<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it just disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include browsing a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
