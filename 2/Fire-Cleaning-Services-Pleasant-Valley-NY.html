<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Look for visible mold development (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or tough and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furnishings or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).

Basic household fans are not capable of moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a room effectively.</p>
