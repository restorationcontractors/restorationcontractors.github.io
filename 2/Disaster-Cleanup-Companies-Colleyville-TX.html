<p>The area that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel when they are disturbed. Air filtering systems are typically utilized in combination with the sealing of the location to eliminate as numerous airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location involves making use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the blood circulation of air between the contaminated area and the areas around it.

<p>When standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>
