<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on walls and floors is another potential impact of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Musty odors can stick around in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
