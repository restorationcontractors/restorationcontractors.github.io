<p>Whether it occurs in your ceiling because of a leaking roofing, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can trigger you anxiety and stress, particularly if you've never done it before.

Sewage often consists of impurities such as germs, infections, E-Coli, and hepatitis that can have drastic health effects.

<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and eliminate the battery right away. Eliminating the battery quickly might make the difference to conserve your phone. Most phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn pink or red if water has actually damaged the gadget. You can try to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product over night. You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too near the gadget. In some cases cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>
