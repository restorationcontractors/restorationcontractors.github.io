Hard surface areas that are impacted should be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard must be removed and correctly dealt with. Any product that takes in considerable quantities of wetness and can not be properly cleaned must be gotten rid of. As soon as contaminated products have been gotten rid of, a second application of sanitizers should be used to all work surface areas.</p>
