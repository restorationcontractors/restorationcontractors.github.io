<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Blackwater has the potential to cause extreme damage. Although it can be other colors, it is highly unhygienic. Resulting from toilet overflows, sewer backups, and natural flooding there are over a hundred kinds of the disease-causing organism commonly found, such as E. coli, salmonella, hepatitis, rotavirus, and lots of others, along with various species of parasites and fungis. In spite of carrying lethal illness it might appear clear and might not have a foul smell.</p>
