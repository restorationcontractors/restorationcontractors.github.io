<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is completed.<p>
