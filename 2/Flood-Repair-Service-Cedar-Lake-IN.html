Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest action in the process is restoration. Restoration includes replacing products like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as simple as setting up a couple of panels of drywall, while severe cases might require changing entire walls. Exposure to harmful compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older houses are likely to contain these substances.</p>
