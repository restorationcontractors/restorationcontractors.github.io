<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying equipment or techniques will be the most effective. It is vital to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based upon the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in identifying what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building materials and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
