Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard may require fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is major then the entire floor may require replacing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The sort of wood floor covering you may have restricts the type and identifies of repairs that need to take place. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader variety of choices to fix the issue.

Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
