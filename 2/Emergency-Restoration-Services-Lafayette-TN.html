<p>Examine the drywall to see just how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or fall apart to the touch. Eliminate all jeopardized drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels only show water spots but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
