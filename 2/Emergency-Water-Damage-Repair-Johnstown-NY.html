<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of residential or commercial property damage that a household or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
