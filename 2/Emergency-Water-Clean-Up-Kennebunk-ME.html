<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
