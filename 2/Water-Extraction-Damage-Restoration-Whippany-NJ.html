<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at threat of mold growth. Use a facemask or a respirator ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover legs, hands and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the musty location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to disinfect the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent areas. If you utilize bleach, make sure it will not tarnish the material or surface. Place all sponges, equipment and other products utilized in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit instead of the primary home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.
