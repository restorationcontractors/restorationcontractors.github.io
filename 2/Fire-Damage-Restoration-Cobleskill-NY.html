<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a severe, destructive chemical.

There are much safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce unsafe fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to avoid using bleach and if you need to use it, only utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
