<p>You want to resolve bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and agitate the moistened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it could inadvertently push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. If the phone was entirely immersed, you might try vacuuming around the phone's openings and cracks to suck more water out. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is necessary to prevent recontamination. You need to seal and immediately deal with products that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, wash your clothing in hot water, and shower to get rid of spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
