<p>Water invasion into buildings can be extremely devastating. Jake and his men were amazing in assisting us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed everything they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going person.</p>
