<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can provide your living-room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and cracked chimney can frequently let in rain throughout the chillier months which can seep through the walls. Gradually, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to flake, peel and bubble. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a worn out and unloved area.<p>
<p>With spore count readings to the parts per million, even the smallest amount of air impurities will be detected and stopped by the specialists at Midwest Mold Removal.
