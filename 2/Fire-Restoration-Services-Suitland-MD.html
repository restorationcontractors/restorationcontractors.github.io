<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days.
